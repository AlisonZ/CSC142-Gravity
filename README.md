where ME 􏰅 5.98 􏰍 1024 kg is the mass of the Earth, r the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite in meters, and G 􏰅 6.67 􏰍 10􏰃11 m3/kg 􏰈 s2 the universal gravitational constant. The unit of the velocity v is m/s. Write a program that inputs the radius r and outputs the satellite’s velocity. Confirm that a satellite that is closer to the Earth travels faster. Define symbolic constants for ME and G. The distance to the Hubble Space Telescope from the center of the Earth, for example, is approximately 6.98 􏰍 106 m.
