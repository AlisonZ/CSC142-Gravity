where ME 􏰅 5.98 􏰍 1024 kg is the mass of the Earth, r the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite in meters, and G 􏰅 6.67 􏰍 10􏰃11 m3/kg 􏰈 s2 the universal gravitational constant. The unit of the velocity v is m/s. Write a program that inputs the radius r and outputs the satellite’s velocity. Confirm that a satellite that is closer to the Earth travels faster. Define symbolic constants for ME and G. The distance to the Hubble Space Telescope from the center of the Earth, for example, is approximately 6.98 􏰍 106 m.



Write all the code for a class RadiationSample. There are only 2 fields in this class, a String that contains the date and time that the sample was logged, and a field that holds the number of counts per minute recorded, for that date and time. (the format of the date and time within the String does not matter, for this problem.)
The values for the date/time String, and the number of counts per minute are set in the constructor, so there are no “set” methods in the class. There are 2 “get” methods, one to return the String, and one to return the number of counts per minute.
